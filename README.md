### Goal: solve a task of archive page images sorting (for their further content-based processing)

**Scope:** Processing of images, training / evaluation of models,
input file/directory processing, class (category) results of top
N predictions output, predictions summarizing into a tabular format, 
HF 😊 hub support for the model, multiplatform (Win/Lin) data
